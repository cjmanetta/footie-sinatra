## TO DO
- add uniqueness constraint to a users activites ie. a player can only have one score for each individual challenge (change seed file too)
- other validations
- coaches need a form to input scores or update scores
- coaches need to see overall team rankings

- users need to have an age
- users need to be able to edit there own info
- route for each activity that has all its info - partial?
- naaaaaav
- styles
- #WISHLIST: players need a list of upcoming challenges and overdue challenges
-#WISHLIST: search for a player or a an activity

## FIXES
- appended challenge doesnt have edit form functionality because the toggle is in document ready - trade off is that edit form shows and hides real fast after the button is clicked (ask about this on friday)
